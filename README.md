## Developing

[Truffle][2] is used to develop and test the Mobius Smart Contract. This has a dependency of [Node.js][3].

Pre-requirements:

[yarn][4] needs to be installed (but [npm][5] should work just as well).

    yarn install

This will install all the required packages.

Start `testrpc` in a separate terminal tab or window.

    yarn testrpc
    
    # in separate window or tab
    yarn truffle

This will compile the contract, deploy to the testrpc instance and run the tests.
